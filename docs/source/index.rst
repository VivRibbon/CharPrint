Welcome to CharPrint's documentation!
=====================================

**CharPrint** is a simple but robust library intended for expressive test projects, such as diital poetry and text-based games. It can be used with curses windows, a bare console, or as input into your own pipeline.

.. note::
   At the moment the project is untested on Windows and Mac. It should work identically, but please let me know if it doesn't.
